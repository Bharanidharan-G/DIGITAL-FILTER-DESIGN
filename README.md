# DIGITAL-FILTER-DESIGN

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: BHARANIDHARAN

INTERN ID: CT08OPX

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW:

This project involves designing and simulating a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog or MATLAB. The FIR filter is implemented for digital signal processing applications, ensuring accurate filtering with stable response characteristics.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Implement an FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB.
Perform simulation to validate the filter's response.
Analyze the filter’s performance based on frequency response and stability.

DELIVERABLES:

✅ Verilog Code for FIR Filter
✅ Simulation Results Demonstrating Filter Operation
✅ Performance Analysis of the FIR Filter

INSTRUCTIONS:

Clone this repository.
Implement the FIR filter using Verilog or MATLAB.
Simulate the design using appropriate tools (ModelSim, MATLAB Simulink, etc.).
Analyze the filter’s response and document the results.
